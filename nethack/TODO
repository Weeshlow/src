	- nethack page of the author of the unified patch I started with
	- do the bonesdir.diff patch, seems useful.
	- do other good patches (Priest races, window edge, etc) listed there.

Do the makefile patching *after* the call to setup.sh (which moves the correct Makefiles to their locations)
	- Do it before anyways?

Check out sys/unix/ files for more hacking possibilities?

MORE STUFF! There are 264 patches in the NHPDB, I'm sure there are a few more awesome patches out there :)
